Use cases
=========

Once the infrastucture is up and running, different use cases and scenrios can be tried and tested on this environment

**New Use Cases will be added periodically to provide additional senarios**

.. note::

   Once use cases are executed and you are done using the environment make sure to teardown the lab infrastucture using the steps in the next section
