FAQ and troubleshooting

Q:Tasks being run by the provisioner?
-------------------------------------

The provision_lab.yml playbook creates a work bench for each
student, configures them for password authentication, and creates an
inventory file for each user with their IPâ€™s and credentials. An
instructor inventory file is also created in the current directory which
will let the instructor access the nodes of any student. This file will
be called ``instructor_inventory.txt``

Q:What gets created on AWS 
--------------------------

- AWS VPC creation (Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Cloud) 
- Creation of an SSH key pair (stored at ./WORKSHOPNAME/WORKSHOPNAME-private.pem) 
- Creation of a AWS EC2 security group - Creation of a subnet for the VPC
- Creation of an internet gateway for the VPC - Creation of route table for VPC (for reachability from internet)

Q:What EC2 instances does provisioner spin up
---------------------------------------------

- One ansible control node using a Centos image 
- Two webservers using a Centos image 
- One BIG-IP using the BEST license (pre-licensed)

Q.What tasks does provisioner perfrom on the BIG-IP
---------------------------------------------------

- Changes the default MGMT password
